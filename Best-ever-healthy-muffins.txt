                                            BEST EVER HEALTHY MUFFINS

This recipe comes from my daughter, Dana. It is a great, healthy muffin and a welcome surprise for summer weekend guests.  In fact, this recipe is a big favorite of Virginia Strullâ€™s, who owns the Sugar Maple Suite (a bed & breakfast in Claverack, NY).  She serves these delicious muffins to her lucky guests.
